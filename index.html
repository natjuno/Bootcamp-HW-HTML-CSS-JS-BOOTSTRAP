              <p>A case study for a travel app that addresses concerns regarding the pandemic. The prototype is below. However, the bulk of this project lied in user research. I interviewed 5 people from a variety of age groups. Their reasons for travelling were just as diverse. I wanted to see how they felt about traveling after the pandemic.</p>
              <ol type="1">
                <li>What are your expectations for travel post-pandemic?
                </li>
                <li>Why are these your expectations?
                </li>
                <li>If you are comfortable, can you tell me how you feel about disclosing your vaccination status?</li>
                <li>Have you travelled in 2020 and/or 2021? Where to?
                </li>
                <li>Can you tell me how that was different from travel before the pandemic?
                </li>
                <li>How do you think international travel will change in response to the aftermath of COVID-19?
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                What I gathered from their responses was that a primary concern for travel was the increased cost. The youngest interviewees were college students, one who studied abroad was worried about the rising prices of airfare. All of these people had travelled during the pandemic but what had changed about travel is that they took road trips instead of flying. They also booked an Airbnb instead of a hotel. Their reasons for these changes were that they had less contact with strangers.

          <h2>Affinity Mapping</h2>
            <p>I took their responses and organized them into the following categories: 2021 travel, 2020 travel, International vs Domestic travel, budget concerns, vaccination statuses, and thoughts on flying and returning to normal. Traveling in 2020 and 2021 had changed and restrictions regarding flight varied. The interviewees had different feelings about international and domestic travel. While both will become more complicated, domestic travel is expected to have a faster return to normalcy. People are not comfortable with traveling overseas. Most agreed that travel will become more expensive and continue to be more expensive than it was pre-COVID. All participants are comfortable with disclosing their vaccination status.</p>
